### Course 1: How Google does Machine Learning
What is machine learning, and what kinds of problems can it solve? Google thinks about machine learning slightly differently -- of being about logic, rather than just data. We talk about why such a framing is useful for data scientists when thinking about building a pipeline of machine learning models

#### Week 1:

- Use machine learning to transform the way you do business


#### Week 2:

- Acquire the organizational know-how to implement machine learning.
- Leverage Google's experience to avoid common pitfalls.

#### Week 3:

- Analyze data using AI Platform Notebooks and BigQuery
- Describe computation and storage needs




   
### Course 2: Launching into Machine Learning
Starting from a history of machine learning, we discuss why neural networks today perform so well in a variety of data science problems. We then discuss how to set up a supervised learning problem and find a good solution using gradient descent. This involves creating datasets that permit generalization; we talk about methods of doing so in a repeatable way that supports experimentation.

#### Week 1:

- Identify why deep learning is currently popular
- Optimize and evaluate models using loss functions and performance metrics
- Mitigate common problems that arise in machine learning
- Create repeatable training, evaluation, and test datasets

#### Week 2:

- Differentiate between the major categories of ML problems
- Place major ML methods in the context of their historical development
- Identify why deep learning is currently popular

#### Week 3:

- Quantify model performance using loss functions
- Use loss functions as the basis for an algorithm called gradient descent
- Optimize gradient descent to be as efficient as possible
- Use performance metrics to make business decisions

#### Week 4:


### Course 3: Introduction to TensorFlow
This course is focused on using the flexibility and “ease of use” of TensorFlow 2.x and Keras to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. You will learn about the TensorFlow 2.x API hierarchy and will get to know the main components of TensorFlow through hands-on exercises. We will introduce you to working with datasets and feature columns. You will learn how to design and build a TensorFlow 2.x input data pipeline. You will get hands-on practice loading csv data, numPy arrays, text data, and images using tf.Data.Dataset. You will also get hands-on practice creating numeric, categorical, bucketized, and hashed feature columns.


### Course 4: Feature Engineering
Want to know how you can improve the accuracy of your ML models? What about how to find which data columns make the most useful features? Welcome to Feature Engineering where we will discuss good vs bad features and how you can preprocess and transform them for optimal use in your models.


### Course 5: Art and Science of Machine Learning
Welcome to the Art and Science of machine learning. This course is delivered in 6 modules. The course covers the essential skills of ML intuition, good judgment and experimentation needed to finely tune and optimize ML models for the best performance. You will learn how to generalize your model using Regularization techniques and about the effects of hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate on model performance. We’ll cover some of the most common model optimization algorithms and show you how to specify an optimization method in your TensorFlow code.
